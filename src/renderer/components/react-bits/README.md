React Bits in ERB

This folder is a convenient place to add React Bits components you install (TS-CSS variant).

How to add a component:

- From reactbits.dev, pick a component and select the TS-CSS variant.
- Use the provided CLI command (jsrepo/shadcn) or copy the code files manually.
- Place the component file(s) under this folder and any CSS alongside or in your global styles.
- Import and use in your app like any other component.

Notes:

- Tailwind is not required here; this repo is set up for CSS/Sass already.
- If you choose a Tailwind variant later, you'll need Tailwind + PostCSS wired.
